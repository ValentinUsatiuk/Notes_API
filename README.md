## Name of project: Notes API

### Brief description
The Notes API is a simple software interface (API)
designed for managing user notes. 
This API allows users to create, store, update, and delete their notes. 
Each user has the ability to register in the system 
and authorize themselves to access their list of notes.

The main features of the API include:

- Registering new users and storing their account information.
- Authorizing users to access their notes.
- Creating new notes with titles and text.
- Retrieving a list of all user notes.
- Retrieving information about a specific note by its identifier.
- Updating note information, including the title and text.
- Deleting user notes.

The Notes API is an excellent solution for developing applications 
that require functionality for managing user notes, 
such as notebooks, idea storage apps, to-do lists, and many others.
